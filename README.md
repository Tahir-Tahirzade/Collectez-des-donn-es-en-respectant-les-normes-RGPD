#  Collect_data_in_compliance_with_GDPR_standards

## A) Project Overview:
 <FONT size="26pt">  Dev'Immediat, an auto insurance subsidiary, faces GDPR-related sanctions. To remedy this, I am tasked with recommending immediate CRM data management rules, anonymizing data for the commercial team, and creating a comprehensive report. The recommendations aim to ensure GDPR compliance, and the anonymization process involves using Microsoft Power Query on extracted data. The report, a synthesis of quality processes in data collection and preparation, is vital for repeated application during the sanction period. Attachments include the client database, data dictionary, and a checklist for guidance. The mission is crucial to regain full operational capacity within legal boundaries.</FONT>
